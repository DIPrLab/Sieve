# Sieve 

![Sieve Logo](images/logo.png)

SIEVE is a general purpose middleware to support access control in DBMS that enables them to scale query processing with very large number of access control policies. Full version of the paper can be seen at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07498). 


## Setup

1. Download [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
2. Create a user "sieve" and grant privileges of DBA role.
3. Create a Schema called "sieve".
4. Populate the schema with the data that can be found inside the directory (data/wifi_dataset.tar.xz for MySQL and data/mall_dataset.tar.xz for PostgreSQL)
   1. Extracted files are sql dump files.
   2. Import the table definition (wifi_defn.sql/ mall_defn.sql)
   3. Import the data (wifi_data.sql/ mall_data.sql)
5. Update the sample.properties file found inside the src/main/resources/credential.sample directory with the DBMS properties

## Usage

1. Install any java code editor (maven extension required) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) (comes with inbuilt maven requirements)
2. Open the sieve project.
3. Set the dbms and table_name options in resources/config/general.properties
4. Set true for the experiments that you wish to run (Options: Query Performance, Policy Scale up)
5. Compile the code
```
mvn clean install

```
6. Execute it with
```
mvn exec:java 
```
